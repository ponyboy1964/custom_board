Create your own board!

-Customizable sized board (customsizeXcustomsize2)
	- backend - C 2d array of chars? maybe ints depending on number of allowed objects to be placed on board
			block of memory with an offset which equals the size of each row
-Custom pieces
	- User can click a button and create a "piece"
		-choose its stats
			-size
			-type (npc, pc, object, building?...)

-When a user clicks on a space it selects the piece that is there
	-gives options based on what the object is
		

-When a DM clicks on a space it gives the option to change a piece (if one is present) or create a piece

Questions:
	How to make round things?
		-Just in the picture i.e it takes up the whole block but picture in front end is only half
		the block?
	Something that is smaller than a block?
		-Same as above
