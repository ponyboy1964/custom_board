Create your own board!

-Customizable sized board (customsizeXcustomsize2)
	- backend - C 2d array of chars? maybe ints depending on number of allowed objects to be placed on board
			block of memory with an offset which equals the size of each row
-Custom pieces
	- User can click a button and create a "piece"
		-choose its stats
			-size
			-type (npc, pc, object, building?...)

-When a user clicks on a space it selects the piece that is there
	-gives options based on what the object is
		

-When a DM clicks on a space it gives the option to change a piece (if one is present) or create a piece

Questions:
	How to make round things?
		-Just in the picture i.e it takes up the whole block but picture in front end is only half
		the block?
	Something that is smaller than a block?
		-Same as above


Design:
	-Boards are stored locally as a file (need to design format) - a giant list corresponding to the play board with None for blank spaces and a char = piece for pieces
	-User runs main with args specifying new board or existing board
	New Board
		-Prompt user for input: board size - initial args for this?
					environment - more for front end visualization (desert, forest) for coloring and such
					initial time of day - concept of time may be a future thing
		-Memory allocated for board size
		-Blank list written to file (filename probs just name of the board - args)
		-Should each change be immediately written to file or save command to save the current additions
		-Sends data to front end (blank)
		-waits for DM to give it a command
	Existing Board
		-reads the file specified and populates memory with all the data
		-sends data to front end
		-waits for DM to give it a command
	
	
Commands
	DungeonMaster (DM)
		Create a piece - adds a piece to the directory of pieces
		Place a piece - looks up the piece in the directory and places it at the given location in memory
		Remove a piece - deletes a piece from memory
		Change mode - Combat, non-combat, lock, unlocked
	
	Players
		If mode is lock DM has to approve everything, unlock is pretty much w/e 
			Mode = combat - limited (has to be their turn)
			Mode = non-combat - pretty much w/e 
		Move - select's their piece and lets them move a distance
		
Pieces
	Creatures
		Can be player controlled (players, followers) or non-player controlled (monsters)
	Nature
		Trees, bushes, grass, rocks, water, etc...
	Structures
		Homes, inns, churches, etc...
	Objects (player made thing usually)
		various items: sword, bucket, armor, bedroll

	None of this matters - the only thing backend needs to know is size (and assign it a char)
			    - front end will convert char to an image to display (given by DM/users)
