Create your own board!

This was thought of to supplement a Pathfinder game.

The ultimate goal is for ppl to be able to play pathfinder over the internet.

The DM can use this to create and manage the board. At first it should probably
	start off small, but as this project grows it can scale as well.

Once the DM has created it, users can "sign-in" and will have control over their character (created by the DM).

Initially the players will only be able to move their piece. As this project grows it can be expanded to do more stuff.

The DM can set modes (i.e. combat vs non-combat); during combat players have to have their moves approved by the DM; during non-combat they can pretty much move wherever they want (should probably be restricted)
